# Event 360

This project is a dynamic and responsive dashboard for event management with a beautiful landing page. The dashboard allows the user to create, edit, delete, and view services, events and recent events. The landing page shows the services, events and recent events images by fetching from the api. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.

## Project Decisions

The following libraries and frameworks were used for this project:

- React.js: A popular library for building user interfaces with components and hooks.
- Context API: A built-in state management solution in React that allows passing data through the component tree without props.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework.
- React Router DOM: A declarative routing library for React that enables navigation between different pages or components.
- Framer Motion: A Tailwind based animation library for React that enables seamless animations.
- Axios: A popular, promise-based HTTP client that offers an easy-to-use API for making asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript, widely used due to its automatic transformation of JSON data, error handling capabilities, and browser & node.js compatibility.
- Tanstack React Query: A powerful asynchronous state management that tosses out that granular state management, manual refetching and endless bowls of async-spaghetti code. TanStack Query gives you declarative, always-up-to-date auto-managed queries and mutations that directly improve both developer and user experiences.
- Tanstack React Table: A headless UI for building powerful tables & data grids.
- Shadcn UI: A CLI for adding standalone tailwind components to your project.
